# the packages with FreeBSD's own tools, installs the one for this machine and proves that the

# the input folder (packaging/freebsd/check-lib.sh): expected_user and answers.
#
# It also builds the signed package repository. The input archive on the fourth disk holds
# keys/splicefs.rsa(.pub) and the packages published before (repo/FreeBSD:<major>:<cpu>/All/).
# The output gets repo/FreeBSD:<major>:<cpu>/ with the new package and the catalog of all
# packages that pkg repo signed. The package of this machine is installed from that repository with the signature
# check on, and a repository signed with another key must be refused.
